# Architecture Compliance Status

**Status:** ✅ COMPLIANT  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-05  
**Architecture Pattern:** Backend-Driven UI with Layered Separation

## Overview

The Classic Traveller character generator follows a clean three-layer architecture with strict separation of concerns. All game rules and logic are centralized in the backend, with the frontend serving as a pure presentation layer.

## Layer Separation

### Rules Layer (`character_generation_rules.py`)
- ✅ All Classic Traveller 1977 game rules and mechanics
- ✅ Character generation logic and state management
- ✅ Game constants and default values
- ✅ Probability calculations and dice rolling
- ✅ Career progression and aging rules

### API Layer (`app.py`)
- ✅ Thin REST API interface to rules layer
- ✅ Request/response handling and validation
- ✅ No business logic or game rule decisions
- ✅ Configuration endpoints (`/api/ui_config`)

### Presentation Layer (`static/script.js`)
- ✅ User interface and interaction handling
- ✅ Display logic and visual feedback
- ✅ Backend API consumption only
- ✅ No hardcoded game rules or constants

## Compliance Verification

### ✅ Game Logic Centralization
- All characteristic quality thresholds in backend
- Retirement eligibility rules backend-controlled
- Default values (starting age, terms) from backend configuration
- No game rule duplication between layers

### ✅ UI Configuration Backend-Driven
- Characteristic styling via `/api/ui_config` endpoint
- Game defaults provided by `get_game_defaults()` function
- Frontend adapts to backend configuration changes

### ✅ State Management
- Character state controlled entirely by backend
- Frontend reflects backend state via API calls
- No frontend-only game state or logic

## Architecture Benefits

- **Maintainability:** Game rule changes only require backend updates
- **Consistency:** Single source of truth for all game mechanics
- **Testability:** Business logic isolated and easily testable
- **Scalability:** Clean API boundaries support future enhancements

## Monitoring

This architecture should be maintained by:
- ✅ Keeping all game rules in `character_generation_rules.py`
- ✅ Using backend APIs for all game logic in frontend
- ✅ Adding new game constants to `get_game_defaults()` function
- ✅ Reviewing any frontend hardcoded values during code reviews
