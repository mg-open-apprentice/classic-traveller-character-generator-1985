# Classic Traveller Character Generator - Code Verification Report

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive verification that all Classic Traveller Book 1 (1977) rules are correctly implemented in the character generation system.

## ✅ Test Results Summary

**Status: ALL RULES FIRING CORRECTLY**

All game mechanics have been verified to work according to the original Classic Traveller Book 1 rules.

---

## Standard Character Generation Flow

### ✅ Commission Services (Navy/Marines/Army/Merchants)

**Sequence**: Survival → Commission → Promotion → Skills → Aging → Reenlistment

- **Survival Check**: Proper target numbers and characteristic bonuses
- **Commission Check**: 
  - Correct restrictions (not if drafted in first term, not if already commissioned)
  - Proper target numbers: Navy(10), Marines(9), Army(5), Merchants(4)
  - Grants +1 skill eligibility on success
- **Promotion Check**: 
  - **Book 1 Rule Enforced**: Only commissioned officers can be promoted
  - Proper target numbers: Navy(8), Marines(9), Army(6), Merchants(10)
  - Respects maximum rank limits
  - Grants +1 skill eligibility on success
- **Skills**: Correct eligibility counts and table access
- **Aging**: Age increments by +4 years for survived characters
- **Reenlistment**: Terms_served increments regardless of outcome

### ✅ Non-Commission Services (Scouts/Others)

**Sequence**: Survival → Skills → Aging → Reenlistment

- **Commission/Promotion**: Correctly marked as "not applicable"
- **Skills**: Scouts get +2 eligibilities per term (vs +1 for others)
- **Aging/Reenlistment**: Same as commission services

---

## Special Flows

### ✅ Injured Character Flow

**Sequence**: Survival (fail) → Skip Commission/Promotion/Skills → Aging → Medical Discharge

- **No Skill Eligibilities**: Injured characters correctly skip all skill resolution
- **Reduced Aging**: +2 years instead of +4 years
- **Medical Discharge**: Automatic, no reenlistment roll needed
- **Term Completion**: Terms_served still increments (character completes the term)

### ✅ Reenlistment Special Cases

#### Mandatory Retention (Roll of 12)
- **Rule**: Roll of 12 always results in retention regardless of player preference
- **Verified**: Player wanting to "discharge" but rolling 12 gets "retained"

#### Seventh Term Limit
- **Rule**: In 7th term and beyond, only roll of 12 allows reenlistment
- **Verified**: Roll of 8 in 7th term results in discharge

#### Retirement Eligibility
- **Rule**: Retirement option available from 5th term onwards
- **Verified**: 
  - 4th term options: ['leave', 'reenlist']
  - 5th term options: ['retire', 'reenlist']

## Aging System

### ✅ Aging Thresholds and Effects

| Age Range | Thresholds | Characteristics | Target Numbers | Loss |
|-----------|------------|----------------|----------------|------|
| **Phase 1** | 34, 38, 42, 46 | STR, DEX, END | 8, 7, 8 | 1 each |
| **Phase 2** | 50, 54, 58, 62 | STR, DEX, END | 9, 8, 9 | 1 each |
| **Advanced** | 66+ (every 4 years) | STR, DEX, END, INT | 9, 9, 9, 9 | 2, 2, 2, 1 |

### ✅ Aging Verification Results

- **Threshold Detection**: Aging checks triggered at correct ages
- **Target Numbers**: Verified against Book 1 tables
- **Characteristic Losses**: Properly applied and logged
- **Individual Check Logging**: Each aging roll recorded with details

**Example Aging Test (Age 30 → 34)**:
```
STRENGTH: rolled 10 vs target 8, loss = 0
DEXTERITY: rolled 7 vs target 7, loss = 0  
ENDURANCE: rolled 6 vs target 8, loss = 1
Final: STR=10, DEX=10, END=9 (lost 1 END)
```

## Term Completion Logic

### ✅ Critical Timing Rules

| Phase | Action | What Increments |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Aging** | Character ages | `age` += 2 or 4 years |
| **Reenlistment** | Character completes term | `terms_served` += 1 |

### ✅ Equal Aging Rule

**Verified**: Both successful and failed reenlistment characters age equally
- Characters age BEFORE reenlistment decision affects their career
- This ensures fair aging regardless of reenlistment outcome

## Service-Specific Rules

### ✅ Enlistment Targets and Bonuses

| Service | Target | Characteristic Bonuses |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
| **Navy** | 8 | INT≥8(+1), EDU≥9(+2) |
| **Marines** | 9 | INT≥8(+1), STR≥8(+2) |
| **Army** | 5 | DEX≥6(+1), END≥5(+2) |
| **Scouts** | 7 | INT≥6(+1), STR≥8(+2) |
| **Merchants** | 7 | STR≥7(+1), INT≥6(+2) |
| **Others** | 3 | None |

### ✅ Survival Targets and Bonuses

| Service | Target | Characteristic Bonuses |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
| **Navy** | 5 | INT≥7(+2) |
| **Marines** | 6 | END≥8(+2) |
| **Army** | 5 | EDU≥6(+2) |
| **Scouts** | 7 | END≥9(+2) |
| **Merchants** | 5 | INT≥7(+2) |
| **Others** | 5 | INT≥9(+2) |

### ✅ Reenlistment Targets

| Service | Target |
|---------|--------|
| **Navy** | 6 |
| **Marines** | 6 |
| **Army** | 7 |
| **Scouts** | 3 |
| **Merchants** | 4 |
| **Others** | 5 |

## Skill System

### ✅ Skill Eligibility Rules

- **First Term**: All characters get +2 skill eligibilities
- **Subsequent Terms**: +1 (Scouts get +2)
- **Commission Success**: +1 additional eligibility
- **Promotion Success**: +1 additional eligibility

### ✅ Skill Table Access

- **Personal/Service/Advanced**: Always available
- **Education**: Available only if EDU ≥ 8

---

## Data Integrity

### ✅ Table Validation

All game tables verified against Classic Traveller Book 1:
- ✅ Enlistment tables
- ✅ Survival tables  
- ✅ Commission tables
- ✅ Promotion tables
- ✅ Skill tables (all services)
- ✅ Aging thresholds and effects
- ✅ Mustering out tables
- ✅ Rank title tables

### ✅ Centralized Table Architecture

- All tables moved to `character_generation_tables.py`
- Built-in validation ensures data consistency
- Clean separation between data and game logic

---

## Complete Flow Verification

### ✅ Multi-Term Character Test

**Test Character**: Navy Officer
- **Term 1**: Survival → Commission → Promotion → Skills → Aging (18→22) → Reenlistment (Success)
- **Result**: Age 22, Terms 1, Rank 2, Ready for Term 2

**All state transitions working correctly**:
- Flag management (`ready_for_skills`, `ready_for_ageing`, `ready_for_reenlistment`)
- Proper sequence enforcement
- Correct data persistence

---

## Conclusion

✅ **ALL CLASSIC TRAVELLER BOOK 1 (1977) RULES VERIFIED**

The character generation system correctly implements:
- All service-specific rules and tables
- Proper term sequence and timing
- Commission/promotion restrictions
- Aging effects and thresholds  
- Reenlistment special cases
- Injury and medical discharge handling
- Multi-term character progression

The system is ready for production use and faithfully reproduces the Classic Traveller character generation experience.
